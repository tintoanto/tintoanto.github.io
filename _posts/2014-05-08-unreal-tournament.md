Unreal Tournament 2004 is my second-most favorite game of all time. Being the gigantic nerd that I am, I attend LAN parties and gaming conventions like [QuakeCon](http://www.quakecon.org/) as regularly as I can, and UT2k4 is a staple in the traditional gaming repertoire. I also love open source stuff, and services that further the spirit of open source, like [GitHub](http://www.github.com).

That's why I'm so excited about way Epic is developing the newest installment of Unreal Tournament. According to [their announcement](https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/the-future-of-unreal-tournament-begins-today), the entire game will be developed in the open, completely from scratch, using the new [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/).

I think this is the future of software development. Develop in the open for everyone to see, and prove with your code that you're doing things the right way. The analogy I like to use is a cook working in a kitchen that has a window looking into it. It keeps the cook honest, and forces him to not cut any corners.
