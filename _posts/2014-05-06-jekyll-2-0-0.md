title: Jekyll 2.0.0
---

Today, the fine maintainers of the Jekyll project [released](http://jekyllrb.com/news/2014/05/06/jekyll-turns-2-0-0/) Jekyll 2.0.0. I think the most impressive part of that post isn't all of the amazing new features, but the incredible amount of contributors that added code in some form or fashion to the project. What a community!

Congrats to everyone involved!
